# LGBT Flags

making/searching for all svg LGBT symbols and flags and their Hex colors

- [LGBT Flag](https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ficheiro:Gay_Pride_Flag.svg&offset=&limit=500)
- <orientation.fandom.com/wiki>

- Reddit
  - > my suggestion is regrouping by cathegories: sexual orientations, gender identity, romantic orientations; even an euler-venn diagram would be interesting, considering all the overlappings

## To-Do's

- [ ] Split Flags into Categories and subcategories
- [ ] Add more Flags
- [ ] Create a Website to display and search the Flags
